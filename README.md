# ShinyApp-Lumberjack-App
The lumberjack-app is a Shiny Application that predicts tree volume in cubic feet from a linear model using data from the "trees" dataset in the R datasets package.

The lumberjack-app was created as a project for the Coursera DataScience Developing Data Products course from the Johns Hopkins University.
